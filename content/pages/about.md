## Who am I?

**I'm Victoria**, a junior at the University of West Florida. I am studying Biochemistry with the ultimate goal of becoming a physician with a strong background in benchtop science and experience taking interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems. I believe this is a fundamental approach we can take to not just practice medicine, but innovate in our specialties to improve the state of healthcare in the United States and beyond.

For me, medicine is more than just a profession, it is a calling. I am driven by a desire to study as much as possible and to pursue complex specialties that not everyone is capable of. I also understand that the path to becoming a physician is not an easy one. It requires a great deal of hard work, sacrifice, and perseverance. But I am ready for this challenge, and I am committed to doing whatever it takes to achieve my goals. I am confident that with the right training, guidance, and support, I can become the kind of physician that my patients will trust and rely on for years to come.

**THAT**, is who I am.

## What am I passionate about?

        Being in STEM and in a sorority is not a typical combination, but has offered me a unique opportunity to explore my passion for helping others in a different way. As president of the <b>Kappa Delta</b> chapter at the University of West Florida, I am fortunate to lead such a phenomenal group of women. Together, our chapter truly aims to build confidence and inspire actions in others through our philanthropic avenues and leadership opportunities. Demonstrated through annual events to raise awareness and money for Prevent Child Abuse America (PCAA), the women in Kappa Delta gain a sense of service and see how important it is to speak on issues that may be difficult to talk about. While emphasizing the role we play in our community is important to me as president, I also dedicate a lot of my efforts into building leadership skills within my chapter. Through involvement in officer positions, members are taught valuable life skills through maintaining the functionality of the chapter.

        Overall, <b>research</b> has fostered both confidence and community in my life, as I have developed my skills, engaged with others in my field, and contributed to the advancement of knowledge. This has been demonstrated through my positions in research such as serving as a research scholar at the Andrews Research and Education Foundation. This role specifically highlights the environment of trust and belonging that can be built through the collaboration between peers and mentors. This collaborative process can create a sense of community as individuals work together towards a common goal, exchanging ideas and insights along the way. This enhanced understanding can lead to a greater sense of confidence when communicating and sharing ideas with others, such as presenting current research through presentations and proposals.

        Over time, my love for <b>community service</b> has developed through a series of experiences and interactions with others. My volunteering throughout highschool in several nonprofits and clubs has served as an introduction to the sense of fulfillment and purpose that I would soon find through service. My more recent dedication to my community through my sororityâ€™s philanthropy, my church and the Kugelman Honors program, has shown me firsthand the impact my actions can have on those around me, which has strengthened my commitment to making a difference.
