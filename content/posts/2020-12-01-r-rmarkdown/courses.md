# My Favorites

## Organic Chemistry I

Starting off scared to take such an intimidating class, I soon discovered that the puzzle-like problem solving that some found daunting, was what inspired me to learn all that I could about organic chemistry.

## Organic Chemistry II

As I dove more into the unique language of organic chemistry, I found a place for my busy brain to take sanctuary. The complexity of reactions and mechanisms challenged me to navigate my way to a solution with a jumble of knowledge from organic I. This fascinated me and organic II quickly became my joy within the weeks of chaos as a junior.

## Topics in Advanced Chemistry: Food Analysis

The freedom given in this class was something that I had not experienced before in undergrad. With a time of instruction that morphed into self-guided experimentation, this class helped me to explore the creative side of my scientific passion and tested my chemistry knowledge in a laboratory setting.

## Medical Internship

I include this as a class due to the credit I received for my internship at Andrews Research and Education Foundation (AREF). The wide array of skills, experiences, and information I have gathered and continue to gather at AREF has confirmed my captivation for medicine and innovation as well as given me some wonderful friendships.

# Most Impactful

## General Chemistry II Lab

Originally a biomedical sciences major, general chemistry II lecture and lab were the reason I switched to the more chemistry focused major of biochemistry. The professors had a massive impact on me and how I viewed my education. I wanted to feel challenged and excited in my future classes and through my major change I was able to find that.

## Organic Chemistry II

Receiving a departmental award for organic chemistry was a big accomplishment for me. Not only was I seeing the materialization of my efforts, but it was for something that I had such an exciting time learning. Through this, I have been able to find appreciation for how the journey to medical school will have its little victories and the end goal is not the only accomplishment.

## Honors Seminar: The American Identity

Exploring Washington D.C. with the honors program and my peers was impactful for me in more ways than I would have thought going into the trip. I found myself learning things about our honors community, as well as about myself and my personal views. Through these experiences I underwent a mindset change that I believe has helped me to see things with a more open perspective.

# Most Challenging

## University Physics I & II

As a highschool student and college student up until this point, I had not found myself needing to truly study or seek out resources to help me pass a class. With taking physics I & II, I realized I did not really know how to study or ask for help from my professors. These classes were concepts I had not seen before and my brain was not quick to accept them. By experiencing trouble in these courses, I had to come to accept that there would be areas in my life where I would not excel as well as others. Though this was challenging, it was a period of growth that was entirely necessary for me to succeed.

## Honors Core II

I found Core 2 fascinating and I enjoyed the twice a week lectures where I could learn about something that was not science. However, throughout the semester this class occupied, some medical issues became prevalent in my life. Having to take a lower grade in the class than I would have liked, I had to accept the unfortunate realities that life sometimes brings.
